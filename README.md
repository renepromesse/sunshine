These data can help to decide at which time of the year a user should buy a solar panel system, to track the performance of his solar systems etc

**I love software engineering, care about the world, and am always 
thinking/looking for ideas/solutions that can be implemented to improve this life of ours.
Participating in a hackathon like Nasa space apps was not only enjoyable but 
also another opportunity to contribute to our great society. Thanks for your help and even after this hackathon
I will continue to improve this app and even host it on Play Store so that it can be reached by many people. üí™Ô∏èüöÄÔ∏èüòçÔ∏è
I'm learning threejs, and hope my next project will take us back on the moon üòäÔ∏è **
